### Online Etymology Dictionary
bit

*n.*

1

"small piece," c.1200; related Old English *bite* "act of biting," and *bita* "piece bitten off," probably are the source of the modern words meaning "boring-piece of a drill" (1590s), "mouthpiece of a horse's bridle" (mid-14c.), and "a piece bitten off, morsel" (c.1000). All from Proto-Germanic **biton* (cognates: Old Saxon *biti*, Old Norse *bit*, Old Frisian *bite*, Middle Dutch *bete*, Old High German *bizzo* "biting," German *Bissen* "a bite, morsel"), from PIE root **bheid-* "to split" (see [fissure](gdlookup://localhost/fissure)).

Meaning "small piece, fragment" is from c.1600. Sense of "short space of time" is 1650s. Theatrical *bit part* is from 1909. Money sense in *two bits*, etc. is originally from Southern U.S. and West Indies, in reference to silver wedges cut or stamped from Spanish dollars (later Mexican *reals*); transferred to "eighth of a dollar."
