# 3. Untyped Arithmetic Expressions

Tools for a small language of numbers and booleans.  
introduction of several fundamental concepts: abstract syntax, inductive definitions and proofs, evaluation, and the modeling of run-time errors.

## Syntax

## Induction on terms

after definition of terms, we can perform inductions on terms.  
we can give inductive definitions of functions over the set of terms, and we can give inductive proofs of properties of terms.

general method

as the proof is general, somtimes we simply write "by induction of t". That is enough.

## Semantic styles

semantics: how terms are evaluated.
