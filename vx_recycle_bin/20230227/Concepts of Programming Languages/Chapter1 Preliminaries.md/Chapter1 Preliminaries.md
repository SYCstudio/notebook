# Chapter1 Preliminaries

## reasons for studying concepts of programming languages

* Increased capacity to express ideas. Expression power of the language influences the depth of people.  
* Improved background for choosing appropriate languages. Help the programmers to choose the better language with the features that suit the project.  
* Increased ability to lean new languages. Programming languages are still in a state of continues evolution, so as design methodologies, software developing tools. Means continuous learning. With a thorough understading of fundamental concepts of languages, we can easier to learn new languages.  
* Better understanding of the significance of implementation. Why languages are designed the way they are.  
* Better use of languages that are already known.  
* Overall advancement of computing. 

## Programming domains
**Scientific applications**: simple data structure, large number of floating-point arithmetic computations.  
Fortran, ALGOL 60

**Business applications**: producing elaborate report, precies ways of describing and storing decimal numbers and character data, and the ability to specify decimal arithmetic operations.  
COBOL

**Artificial intelligence**: using symbolic rather than numeric computations.  
Lisp, Prolog, Python, Scheme

**Web software**: dynamic Web content.  
HTML, Java, JavaScript, PHP
